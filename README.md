## Is the loaning system that you implemented centralized or decentralized? Point out the demerit(s) of a centralized system.
The loaning system I implemented is centralised as all transactions are managed by the bank and acts as a middleman.
<br/><br/>
### The following are the demerit(s) of a centralised system:
* Privacy breaches and scams by central authority
* Arbitrariness and Unfairness by central authority
* No control/true ownership over the assets by the end user
* System dependent and non-interoperable
* Cost heavy and inefficent
* Non-automate-able
